For this PasswordGenerator, not using useCallback is perfectly fine and simpler. useCallback only preserves a function reference between renders — it doesn't make the function faster.

What useCallback actually does:
It returns a memoized function reference that stays the same across renders until one of its dependencies changes.
It does not memoize function results; it only stabilizes id
entity (referential equality).

# Simpler Terms:

useCallback sirf function ki identity ko stable rakhta hai — logic ya speed ko directly fast nahi banata. Agar aap function ko memoized child ko pass kar rahe ho ya useEffect ke dependency mein use kar rahe ho, tab useCallback useful hai; warna simple useEffect / normal function rakhna best hota hai.

#Kya karta hai useCallback? (Analogy)

Socho tum har render pe ek naya mobile bana rahe ho. Agar child component check karta hai “kya parent ne wohi mobile (function) diya?” aur mobile naya hai toh child ko firse render karna padega.
useCallback ye ensure karta hai ki jab tak dependencies change na ho, wahi mobile (same function reference) rahe — child bina reason ke re-render nahi karega.

#useCallback ye ensure karta hai ki jab tak dependencies change na ho, wahi mobile (same function reference) rahe — child bina reason ke re-render nahi karega. 
#2 With useCallback — child won't re-render just because function reference changed 

*these are contradictory, I am not getting

Good catch — the two lines look contradictory because one is worded a bit loose. Let me cleanly correct and explain it in simple Hinglish with examples so it makes perfect sense.

# Clear, corrected statement (Hinglish)

Without `useCallback`: har render pe function ka naya reference banega → agar tum woh function prop ke through `React.memo` child ko doge, child re-render karega (kyunki props changed dikh rahe hain).

With `useCallback`: function ka reference stable rahega jab tak dependencies change na ho → `React.memo` child ko React same prop nazar aayega → child re-render nahi karega bas is wajah se.

(Previous confusing sentence tried to say the same thing but was poorly phrased — it should be “child won't re-render just because the parent rerendered — provided the function reference stayed the same”.)

# Step-by-step (Hinglish)

*1. `React.memo` karta kya hai?

    Yeh child component ke props ka shallow comparison karta hai. Agar props identical hain (===), child skip kar deta hai re-rendering.

*2. Function as prop:

   JS function ka identity (reference) important hai. Har baar `() => {}` likhne se naya object/reference banta hai.

*3. `useCallback` ka role:

    `useCallback(fn, deps)` wahi `fn` reference dobara return karega jab tak `deps` change na ho. Isliye shallow comparison me prop same dikhega.

# Short code demo (Hinglish) — run mentally or in our app

Without `useCallback` (child re-renders each parent render):

?function Parent() {
?  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

?  const handle = () => console.log("hi"); // new reference each render

?  return (
?    <>
?      <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>Inc parent {count}</button>
?      <Child onDo={handle} />
?    </>
?  );
?}

?  const Child = React.memo(({ onDo }) => {
?  console.log("Child render");
?  return <button onClick={onDo}>Child button</button>;
?}); 

*Har `Inc parent` click pe console: "Child render" bhi aayega — kyunki `handle` naya reference hai.

With `useCallback` (child won't re-render just because parent re-rendered):

?function Parent() {
?  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

?  const handle = useCallback(() => console.log("hi"), []); // stable reference

?  return (
?    <>
?      <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>Inc parent {count}</button>
?      <Child onDo={handle} />
?    </>
?  );
? }

*Ab `Inc parent` pe **Child render** nahi aayega — kyunki `onDo` prop same reference hi hai.

---

# When child *still* re-renders even with useCallback

Agar parent passes other props that change (e.g., `<Child value={count} />`) — child WILL re-render because some other prop changed.
If `useCallback` has dependencies that change, the function reference will change too → child re-renders (expected).

---

# Stale closure note (Hinglish)

Agar tum `useCallback` me dependencies galat do (ya none do), function may capture old state:

const handle = useCallback(() => {
  console.log(count); // might print stale value if count not included in deps
}, []); // WRONG if we expect fresh `count`


Fix:

* include `count` in deps, OR
* use functional updates (`setCount(c => c + 1)`) inside callback so we can safely keep deps minimal.

#(one-line, Hinglish)

`useCallback` reference stable rakhta hai → agar tum function ko memoized child ko prop ke through pass kar rahe ho toh unnecessary child re-renders bachte hain. Agar tum aisa nahi kar rahe, useCallback usually unnecessary hai.

# So in regard to my project, my understanding says, below I don't see the point of using useCallback in this project because the only "things" which can cause re-renders are already passed as dependencies to useCallback which means passwordGenerator function is recreated on every re-render anyway and is never memoized between re-renders because nothing outside of the passed dependencies cause renders, what is our thoughts on this?

Yes — in our current PasswordGenerator, `useCallback` is unnecessary. The generator function will only be useful to memoize if we need a stable function identity (e.g., we pass it to a memoized child or use it as a dependency elsewhere). Otherwise keep it simple (use `useEffect` or a normal handler).

---

## Why our conclusion is correct (short)

`useCallback(fn, [length, checkNumber, checkChar])` will return the same function reference across renders as long as those dependencies don't change.

In our component those three states are the only meaningful inputs to generation, so whenever they change we want regeneration anyway — recreating the function then is fine.

we’re not passing that function to any `React.memo` child and we’re not using it in some other expensive effect, so stabilizing its identity gives we no real benefit.

---

## Nuances worth noting

1. `useCallback` does memoize the function until dependencies change — it’s not true that it’s “never memoized”. It is memoized, but only until one of the deps changes.

2. The only time memoizing helps is when we want to avoid re-renders in a memoized child or avoid re-running an effect that depends on that function. If neither applies, memoization is just extra complexity.

3. `useCallback` brings a tiny runtime/memory overhead and adds dependency-maintenance burden (risk of stale closures if deps are wrong). For a cheap operation (generate up to 100 chars), these costs outweigh any benefit.

---

## Practical examples (what we’d do)

Preferred for our app (no `useCallback`)

Keep generation logic in `useEffect([length, checkNumber, checkChar])` **or**
 Move it to an `onClick` handler for manual generation.

These are simple and bug-resistant.

### When `useCallback` would make sense

If we refactor and pass a `generatePassword` prop to a child that is `React.memo`, and we want that child to avoid re-rendering when parent re-renders for unrelated reasons.

Or if we use the function inside another `useEffect` and want to avoid that effect running except when intended.

Example:

*only useful when Child is memoized and we pass generate to it
?const generate = useCallback(() => {
?  generation logic
?}, [length, checkNumber, checkChar]);

?<Child onGenerate={generate} /> // Child can skip rerenders when generate identity unchanged
---

## Recommendation for our PasswordGenerator

Do not use `useCallback` right now. Keep the logic in `useEffect` or use a button handler to generate on demand.
If later we find we’re passing the generator to a memoized child and see unnecessary renders in profiling, then add `useCallback` at that time.


# Doubt and clarifications:
?const passwordGenerator = useCallback(() => {
?    let pass = ""
?    let str = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
?    if (numberAllowed) str += "0123456789"
?    if (charAllowed) str += "!@#$%^&*-_+=[]{}~`"

?    for (let i = 1; i <= length; i++) {
?      let char = Math.floor(Math.random() * str.length + 1)
?      pass += str.charAt(char)
      
?    }

?    setPassword(pass)


?  }, [length, numberAllowed, charAllowed, setPassword])

?  useEffect(() => {
?    passwordGenerator()
?  }, [length, numberAllowed, charAllowed, passwordGenerator])


# When you wrap passwordGenerator in useCallback, React creates a memoized function that only changes when one of its dependencies changes.

If you now use passwordGenerator inside useEffect, the effect’s dependency array must include it, because from React’s point of view, the effect depends on the current version of that function.

#Why?
- Because if length, isNumAllowed, or isSpecialAllowed change:
- passwordGenerator will be re-created (new function identity)
- useEffect will re-run, since the function in dependencies changed

This ensures: The password gets regenerated automatically when any of those values change.
So in your useEffect, just putting generatePassword in the dependency array is enough
